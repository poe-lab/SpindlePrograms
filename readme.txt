These are the matlab code files (.m) for spindle detectors a1-a6 reported in: 

Warby et al. Sleep spindle detection: crowdsourcing and evaluating performance of experts, non-experts, and automated methods. Nature Methods. (2014).

These files can be opened with a text editor to view, but require MATLAB software to run (http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
